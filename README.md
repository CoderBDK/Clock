# 🕰 Analog Clock in Jetpack Compose
This Analog Clock implementation, built using Jetpack Compose for Android, features an elegant and colorful design with smooth animations.
The clock’s hour, minute, and second hands rotate gracefully, accompanied by a dynamic gradient background that adds vibrancy to the interface.
A unique progress indicator bar tracks the clock’s movement, while bold markers enhance the time display for better readability. Additionally, 
the app provides a digital time display for easy access and understanding. The design is not only visually appealing but also user-friendly, 
with clear indicators for each clock hand, ensuring a seamless and intuitive experience.
